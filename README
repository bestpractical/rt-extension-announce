DESCRIPTION
    The Announce extension gives you an easy way to insert announcements on
    RT pages so all users can see the message. You may want to display a
    banner during maintenance or an unscheduled outage to make sure the
    people fielding customer tickets know that something is going on.

    To post an announcement, create a ticket in the queue you identified in
    the RTAnnounceQueue configuration. The extension displays the two most
    recent updates on new or open tickets in that queue. The subject and
    most recent textual message are displayed. As the incident or
    maintenance progresses, just post the updates to the ticket and the
    announcement will be updated with the latest information.

    You should set up a designated queue for announcement messages so you
    can post tickets only when you want an announcement displayed. You can
    set permissions on the queue to control who can create new announcements
    and who should see them.

    Setting up a designated queue also allows you to customize it in other
    ways. For example, you may not want to send the typical 'ticket create'
    email messages, so you could change or customize the scrips that run or
    create new templates. If you send announcement messages to an email
    list, you could create a list user in RT and add it as a CC to the
    announcement queue. Then messages posted for announcement in RT will
    also be sent to the notification list.
