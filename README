DESCRIPTION
    The Announce extension gives you an easy way to insert announcements on
    the RT homepage so all users can see the message. You may want to
    display a banner during maintenance or an unscheduled outage to make
    sure the people fielding customer tickets know that something is going
    on.

DETAILS
    When you install the extension, a new queue is created called
    RTAnnounce. To post an announcement, create a ticket in that queue. The
    extension displays on the RT homepage the subject and most recent
    correspondence on active tickets in the RTAnnounce queue. As the
    incident or maintenance progresses, just reply to the ticket and the
    announcement will be updated with the latest information.

    When multiple announcements are active, they are ordered by the last
    update time with the announcement with the most recent update coming
    first.

    When the incident is over, resolve the ticket and the announcement will
    be removed.

    Comments on announce tickets are not shown in the announcement. However,
    comments are visible on the ticket for users who have permission to view
    the full ticket. If you have multiple announcements, a new comment
    updates the last updated time and will move the announcement to the top
    of the list.

ANNOUNCEMENT GROUPS
    The RTAnnounce queue has a custom field called 'Announcement Groups'
    which you can use to manage who will see an announcement. If you set no
    value, all users will see the announcement. If you set one or more RT
    groups, only members of those groups will see it.

PERMISSIONS
    By default, the announcements are static text. If you give users the
    ShowTicket right on the RTAnnounce queue, the announcements will have
    links to the source tickets. This will allow users to see the history of
    an announcement or see longer messages that might be truncated on the
    homepage.

    The RTAnnounce queue is a regular queue, so you can control access to
    creating announcements the same way you manage permissions on other
    queues.

    In addition to setting permissions, you may not want to send the typical
    'ticket create' email messages, so you could change or customize the
    scrips that run or create new templates. If you send announcement
    messages to an email list, you could create a list user in RT and add it
    as a CC to the announcement queue. Then messages posted for announcement
    in RT will also be sent to the notification list.

RT-Extension-FormTools
    If you would like to show announcements on FormTools form pages look at
    the configuration option $ShowAnnouncementsInFormTools in the
    CONFIGURATION section below.

CONFIGURATION
  $RTAnnounceQueue
    Use this to change the name of the queue used for announcements. First
    edit the RTAnnounce queue in RT and change its name to your new name.
    Then a line to your RT_SiteConfig.pm to set that new value:

        Set($RTAnnounceQueue, 'Custom Announce Name');

  @AnnounceGroups
    By default, all user defined groups will be listed in "Announcement
    Groups". If you have a large number of groups in your RT, this can make
    for a long list, so you can customize the group list by setting
    @AnnounceGroups in your RT_SiteConfig.pm:

        Set(@AnnounceGroups, 'foo', 'bar', 'baz');

  $ShowAnnouncementsInSelfService
    Set this to true to show announcements on the self service page as well
    as the regular privileged RT page.

  $RTAnnounceAllowHTML
    If set to true, the banner content will be set to 'text/html' and allow
    HTML rendering.

    If the content of the message is large there is an option to wrap the
    content in overflow divs. In the source HTML of the message, wrap the
    bottom part of the message in the following: <div
    class="RTAnnounceBannerOverflow"></div>. The top part of the message
    will be shown with a scrollbar and the part contained in the div will be
    hidden. Users can view the bottom section by scrolling without taking up
    too much room at the top of the page.

  $ShowAnnouncementsInFormTools
    Set this to true to show announcements on FormTools pages.

    You will need to add a custom field to the queue used for announcements.

    First update the @CustomFieldValuesSources config setting to the
    following:

        Set(@CustomFieldValuesSources, (qw(RT::CustomFieldValues::AnnounceGroups RT::CustomFieldValues::FormToolsGroups)));

    Then add create a new custom field and apply it to the queue used for
    announcements:

        Name:                Announcement FormTools Groups
        Type:                Select multiple values
        Field values source: RT user defined FormTools groups for the RT Announce plugin
        Applies to:          Tickets

    When creating a new announcement ticket select values in the new custom
    field to control where the announcement will be displayed.

    If the custom field is left empty the announcement will only display on
    the homepage. If one or more values are selected the announcement will
    only display for the values selected.
